Java: LeapÂ Year


I'm learning Java and I will try code a Leap Year in Java.


What is the Leap Year?
A leap year is a calendar year that contains an additional day added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year.
Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, 
but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. 
For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are.


if (year is not divisible by 4) then (it is a common year)
else if (year is not divisible by 100) then (it is a leap year)
else if (year is not divisible by 400) then (it is a common year)
else (it is a leap year)
