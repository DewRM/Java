Java Practices — Chinese Zodiac

I’m learning Java and I will try code a program in Java that takes the birth date from the user and calculates the value of the Chinese Zodiac.

What is Chinese Zodiac?
Chinese astrology is a type of astrology that has been used for 4000 thousand years and describes people with 12 different signs and symbols. The Chinese Zodiac is an animal ring in which these 12 signs are evenly spaced (10 degrees).
